# angular-material-sass-files
The sass files of the [angular-material repository](https://github.com/angular/material).

Installable via bower
```
bower install -S angular-material-sass-files
```

If something doesn't work, check if the versions of this package and angular-material (roughly) match. The current release of 1.1.3 is compatible with the current release of angular-material 1.1.3.

Please note that you have to manually adjust the theme files for the dynamically injected JavaScript values, if you want to use those. They can be [found in the themes folder](themes/). The same is true for [the checkbox mixin](_mixins.scss) unfortunately.
